# Cooler_System_Project
An Embedded System Project using ATmega32 Microcontroller
## Main Function:
Running a Cooler (DC motor) with a speed which increased when temperature increased and will start to run if the temperature is greater than 35C.
## System consists of:
1. Cooler(DC Motor). 
2. LED and Buzzer. 
3. Microcontroller(Using ATmega32). 
4. Temperature Sensor(Using LM35). 
5. LCD & 7-Segments.
## Details:
1. Cooler, buzzer and LED will be on when temperature is more than 35C and off when less than 35C. 
2. Temperature should be appeared on LCD first row and also in 7-Segments.
3. Cooler speed (Duty Cycle) should be appeared in second row on LCD.
4. Cooler is consists of 5volt DC motor, when the range of temperature is from 35c to 50c the cooler Dc volt should be from 2.5v to 5v.
5. Temperature reading is taken every 1sec.
